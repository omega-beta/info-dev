      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>&emsp; The tundra ecosystem, more commonly known as the tundra biome, is the coldest biome out of all the biomes on Earth. This is partially due to the fact that it is classified as an “ecosystem with a topsoil permafrost and low precipitation, generally found in the mountains and near the Arctic Circle”. Tundras are also generally known for their low vegetation (plants that lie close to the ground), being devoid of trees, and having a lot of snow.</p>
