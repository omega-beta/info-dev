      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>&emsp; The tundra ecosystem, more commonly known as the tundra biome, is the coldest biome out of all the biomes on Earth. This is partially due to the fact that it is classified as an “ecosystem with a topsoil permafrost and low precipitation, generally found in the mountains and near the Arctic Circle”. Tundras are also generally known for their low vegetation (plants that lie close to the ground), being devoid of trees, and having a lot of snow. Also, there are few nutrients in the tundra. Nitrogen and phosphorus are the primary resources in the tundra. All other nutrients come from decaying organic matter near or in the topsoil during the growing season. This varies between tundras, as the arctic tundra is almost devoid of life; the alpine tundra has a growing season of around 180 days.</p>
      <h2>Types of tundra</h2>
      <p>&emsp;There are two main types of tundra: the arctic and the alpine. As the name suggests, the arctic tundra is in the north, or the Arctic. It is considerably big, expanding into the taiga biome as well. However, the arctic tundra is only home to small shrubs, lichens, liverworts, sedges, and mosses. The arctic tundra also has many tempests, which gives an excuse to plants to group together when growing. The animals are very diverse, and many types of fish live in the arctic tundra.</p>
      <p>&emsp;The alpine tundra is a completely different story. It is only considered a tundra because of its high elevation. Similarly to the arctic tundra, the alpine tundra is aptly named for the mountains in which it generally appears. Only very small trees grow here, in addition to the rest of the shrubs and grasses that thrive during the growing season. Unlike the arctic tundra, the alpine tundra is water efficient, meaning that any snow that melts goes into the topsoil and gives it life. However, in the alpine tundra the animals are more adapted to the steep slopes of the mountains they live on.</p>
      <h2>Tundra locations</h2>
      <p>&emsp;The tundra appears generally around the Arctic Circle and mountains. The Arctic tundra is found in Canada, Russia, under the North Pole, and above the South Pole. The Alpine tundra is known for its diverse locations around the world. They can be found anywhere, even in areas considered temperate or taiga. Due to its definition of being in the mountains, it can be found anywhere, including the Alps and the Rocky Mountains.</p>
