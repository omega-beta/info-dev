      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>&emsp;The snowy owl, or the arctic owl, is a bird in the order of Carnivora and in the family of the True Owls. This group includes a variety of other nocturnal owls, and some specific species of hawks. Some True Owls, or Strigidae are external like the snowy owl; they come out in the daytime and sleep at night. Unlike most True Birds, the snowy owl female is slightly larger than the male.</p>
      <h2>Identification and Size</h2>
      <p>&emsp;The females have darker markings and are easier to spot than the males, having the male almost completely white. Their average height is 2.01 to 2.08 feet high, about the size of a soccer ball. They are unexpectedly light, weighing up to ten pounds. Every owlâ€™s feathers have a razor sharp tip that is adequately smooth. This causes less drag, and helps the owl fly more efficiently and without sound. However, because of their bladed tips and smooth and soft feathers, the thermal heat air that lifts the owl up to fly does not cover as much area, so the owl stays low to the ground.</p>
      <h2>Prey</h2>
      <p>&emsp;Owls normally eat smaller scavengers and rodents, but sometimes a solitary (parliament) of owls will catch something as big as a turkey. Diets of normal owls are lemmings, rats, mice, and squirrels. Their beaks are adequate for tearing, so normally they tear prey together.</p>
      <h2>Knowwn features</h2>
      <p>&emsp;Plants are nearly always small in the tundra. Not many different types of plants survive. Lichens, mosses, liverworts, sedges, dwarf trees, and small shrubs all live in the tundra. Generally speaking, these plants live close together to bear the intense weather, with the exception of the woody plants. Many plants have many adaptations to the harsh climate, such as much more productive photosynthesis, better survival, and other survival mechanisms.</p>
      <h2>Types of Animals in the Tundra</h2>
      <p>&emsp;There are many animals in the tundra, but there is not a lot of diversity. Many migratory birds live seasonally in the tundra. Also, many carnivorous mammals live in the tundra. The Arctic fox, the polar bear, and wolves live in the tundra. As well as mammals, many types of fish live in the tundra. Fish like cod, salmon, and trout live in the fluctuating rivers and lakes that exist in the tundra. Small mammals include lemmings, voles, and Arctic hares live in the tundra.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>&emsp;In conclusion, the tundra is a very fascinating biome. It is full of interest and life (though not quite, literally). It is a key profile of the Earth's diversity of life and the amazing adaptations made by animals who live in the tundra.</p>
